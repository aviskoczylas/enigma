# enigma
Enigma is a puzzle based on the iq series from smartgames, with the twist that the grid is made of letters, and you must fit all of the pieces on the grid while the holes in the pieces simultaneously reveal a word. 

This repo contains a solver for any given keyword, pieces, and letter grid. It also contains a file to modify the piece shapes, and a large selection of sample puzzles using a few different letter grids, though all the same piece shapes. 

If you are interested in making a puzzle for your own use, 3d models to print the puzzle board and pieces can be found at ...
