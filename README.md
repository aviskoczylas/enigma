# Enigma
Enigma is a puzzle where you have to fit all of the pieces within a rectangular grid, with the twist that the grid is made of letters. To complete a puzzle, you must be able to fit all of the pieces within a grid, and the holes in the pieces must reveal the puzzle's keyword. 

This repo contains a solver for any given keyword, piece shapes, starter pieces, and letter grid. It plots the solutions in a very clear manner, so you can easily see where to put the pieces. Alternatively, if you just want to see whether a certain word is possible, you can see how many solutions there are without displaying any of them. 

It also contains a file to modify the piece shapes, and over 100 sample puzzles and solutions using a few different letter grids, though all the same piece shapes. The puzzles are labeled by how many starter pieces they have. Each of these sample puzzles only have one solution. Therefore, ones with less starter piece are generally harder, since less information to reach that solution is given. Some of the puzzles and solutions are also in pdf form for easy printing.

Finally, it also includes an explanation of some common tips and tricks that can save you a lot of time when attempting some of the harder puzzles. There are some incredibly difficult puzzles here, so if you are looking to tackle anything with 2 or less starter pieces, I highly recommend reading it first.
