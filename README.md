# enigma
Enigma is a puzzle where you have to fit all of the pieces within a rectangular grid, with the twist that the grid is made of letters, and the holes in the pieces reveal the letters of a word. 

This repo contains a solver for any given keyword, piece shapes, starter pieces, and letter grid. It plots the solutions in a very clear manner, so you can easily see where to put the pieces. Alternatively, if you just want to see whether a certain word is possible, you can se how many solutions there are without displaying any of them. It also contains a file to modify the piece shapes, and a large selection of sample puzzles and solutions using a few different letter grids, though all the same piece shapes. The difficulty of these puzzles range from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest).
