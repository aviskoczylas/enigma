# Enigma
Enigma is a puzzle where you have to fit all of the pieces within a rectangular grid, with the twist that the grid is made of letters. To complete a puzzle, you must be able to fit all of the pieces within a grid, and the holes in the pieces must reveal the puzzle's keyword. 

This repo contains over 100 sample puzzles and solutions using a few different letter grids, though all the same piece shapes. The puzzles are labeled by how many starter pieces they have. Each of these sample puzzles only have one solution. Therefore, ones with less starter piece are generally harder, since less information to reach that solution is given.

It also has a solver for any given keyword, piece shapes, starter pieces, and letter grid. It plots the solutions in a clear manner, so you can easily see where to put the pieces. Alternatively, if you just want to see whether a certain word is possible, you can see how many solutions there are without displaying any of them. You can modify the piece shapes as well.

Finally, it also includes an explanation of some common tips and tricks. They are mostly useful for the very difficult puzzles, so if you are looking to try those I highly recommend reading it first.
